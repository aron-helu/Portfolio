      I previously worked remotely as an intern for 4 months in Viragoes located in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, as a front-end developer for vending machines&apos; touchless checkout technology. Customers simply use their phone camera pointed at the screen and are instantly directed to a website through which they can control the machine in real-time,
      select products, view information, buy, and check out the product. To achieve this development, we used a framework called React for the front-end and the Django Rest framework for the back-end.

            â€œHello! My name is Aron. I am a full-stack developer completing Microverse an intense hands-on online programming school that teaches software while cracking real code projects for 8 hours a day remotely with fantastic partners from around the world in a multicultural environment that encourages kindness and collaboration.
            I am studying to develop skills that others need in software solutions. Solving problems is one of the soft skills I have mastered, as people will always need them. Developing these skills provides me with opportunities to enhance your company&apos;s needs and requirements, and I am an absolute opportunist.
            I have a deep passion for technology and the ability to change lives with code.
